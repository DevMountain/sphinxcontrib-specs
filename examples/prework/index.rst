====================
React Native Prework
====================

This is the prework for the React Native course. It includes development environment setup
instructions and a React tutorial --- based on React's
`official tic-tac-toe tutorial <https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe>`_ ---
where you'll build a small tic-tac-toe game. The tutorial doesn't assume any existing
React knowledge. Since React Native is based on React, the techniques you'll learn in the
tutorial are fundamental to building any React app, and fully understanding it will give
you a deep understanding of React.
