Setup for the tutorial
======================

What are you building?
----------------------

In this tutorial, you'll build an interactive tic-tac-toe game with React.

You can see what it will look like when you're finished here:

.. raw:: html

   <iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/trusting-lake-i18f1x?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark&view=preview"
     style="width:100%; height:300px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;
     margin-bottom:1rem;"
     title="trusting-lake-i18f1x"
     allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
     sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
   ></iframe>

We recommend that you check out the tic-tac-toe game above before continuing with the
tutorial: one of the features that you'll notice is that there is a numbered list to the
right of the game's board. This list gives you a history of all of the moves that have
occurred in the game, and it's updated as the game progresses.

Once you've played around with the finished tic-tac-toe game, keep scrolling. You'll
start with a simpler template in this tutorial. Our next step is to set you up so that
you can start building the game.
