Development environment setup
=============================

To get started with React Native development, you'll need to set up a development
environment. In this section, we will walk you through installing and setting up the
following tools and software:

Node.js
   A backend JavaScript runtime needed to run the React toolchain.

VS Code
   A code editor that will help you write and edit your code.

React Native Tools for VS Code
   The official extension for VS Code that provides a rich set of tools for React Native
   development.

Expo Go
